🚀 Building scalable systems. Designing clean architectures. Shipping production-ready software.

<br><br>

I’m a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> & <strong>Mobile Application Developer</strong> passionate about building scalable, production-ready applications with clean frontends backed by secure, high-performance backends.

I specialize in turning complex ideas into reliable systems that perform under real users and real-world traffic.

<br><br>

When I’m not shipping code, you’ll find me:

🔹 Teaching programming concepts on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThenujaCodes" target="_blank"><b>YouTube</b></a>  
🔹 Solving <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/thenujaCodes/" target="_blank"><b>LeetCode</b></a> problems  
🔹 Exploring system design, backend performance, and architecture patterns  

<br>

I care deeply about code quality, scalability, maintainability, and building software that creates real-world impact.
